Updating the Typing Game for the last class of Cohort 3 to demonstrate some of the concepts from the TODO app.

We discussed, JavaScript arrays, the Document Object Model and browser local Storage. We added a scoring section to work on these concepts which will display the top score (fastest typer) and the current(last) score.

The last 2 commits have changes since class on 10/19/22.
